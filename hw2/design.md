### Spring 2015

**Part 1 - Analysis**
* Financial institutions (national and international), business leaders, legislators, government executives, ambassadors and diplomats, academic economists, practicing economists, political scientists, etc. I will be designing for academic economists, practicing economists, and political scientists. These three user-types have similar interests. They are also closest to me personally (I am an economics major with interest in government), so I feel well-qualified to keep their interests in mind.
* Economists might be interested in factors which fundamentally influence who trades with whom, and how much. Are countries inclined to trade a lot with partners whose GDPs are higher, lower, or roughly the same as their own? Are countries inclined to trade with partners within or outside of their continents? To what degree are top trade partner relationships reciprocal? How have all of these trends changed over time? Do countries tend to trade more or less as a fraction of GDP than they used to? Lawmakers might be interested in similar questions, particularly if they have an explicitly legislative bent. For example, lawmakers might want to know how effective international trade agreements (e.g. NAFTA) and domestic trade policy (e.g. tariffs) are at influencing actual trade flows.
* Answering the above questions would involve sorting, filtering, and aggregating. Animated transitions (between years, for example) help the user see what changes in the data. It is imperative to keep the visualizations as simple as possible, because a data set of this size (119 countries times 10 trade partners times 18 years) can get messy very quickly.

**Part 3 - Reflection**
* If you compared all of our design options, our groups would seem quite similar. We each chose to design across a fairly broad spectrum of possibilities in order to cover our bases. We differ, however, in which options we think of as superior. The other group was more focused on private-sector business applications, whereas I am more focused on academic economic applications. They also prefer a graph format, whereas I prefer the bar chart. In many ways, that comes down to simple personal preference. The sharing process helped me to fully realize how many different ways you can cut the same data set, depending on where your primary interests lie. Furthermore, examining their design (which seemed overly complex to me) bolstered my desire for simplicity and readability in my final design.
