# Homework 4 - Final Project Proposal 
*This homework is due on Friday, April 3rd 2015, 11:59 pm*

This homework consists of your final project proposal. You can find details about the project proposal on the [CS 171 website](http://www.cs171.org/2015/project/). Your proposal consists of two parts:

1. The project data form that can be [filled out here](http://goo.gl/forms/7mUvvOTtW2).
- The proposal document ([see guidelines](http://www.cs171.org/2015/project/#proposal))

You may only fill out the project data form **once per team**. You must submit your (identical) proposal document **once per person**. Put the project proposal in a file *proposal_lastname1_lastname2_lastname3.pdf* in your git repository. We will judge the proposal document based on its content and document quality, so please use full sentences, correct grammar and include Figures and captions for clarifications.
